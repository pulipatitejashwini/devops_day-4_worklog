# TASK 4: Shell Scripting Basics

## Overview
This task focuses on learning Shell Scripting fundamentals used in DevOps for automating repetitive system tasks.         
I practiced writing basic Bash scripts using variables, conditionals, loops, and redirection, and automated a simple log cleanup/backup task.           

## Tools Used
Primary: Bash            
OS: Linux (Ubuntu)

## Objectives
- Understand shell scripting basics            
- Automate repetitive DevOps tasks              
- Learn script execution and scheduling concepts       

## What I Did
- Created shell script files with proper shebang (#!/bin/bash)                         
- Wrote scripts to:                    
    Print system information                 
    Use variables, if-else conditions, and loops             
    Automate log cleanup and backup                
- Made scripts executable using chmod +x               
- Executed scripts from terminal                  
- Redirected output to log files            
- Added comments for documentation and clarity                 

## Deliverables
- Shell script files               
- Execution screenshots               
- Output log files              

## Final Outcome
Successfully automated basic system and log management tasks using shell scripting, gaining hands-on experience in Linux automation for DevOps.
